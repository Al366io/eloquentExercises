/*
    LOOPING A TRIANGLE
    Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    ######
    #######

    It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

// tester. leave untouched.
console.log(loopingTriangle(7))

/*
    FIZZBUZZ
    Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
    For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 
    (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

    When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are 
    divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only
    one of those).

/*
    CHESSBOARD
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters
    to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. 
    The characters should form a chessboard.

    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

    # # # #
    # # # # 
    # # # #
    # # # # 
    # # # #
    # # # # 
    # # # #
    # # # #
    When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 
    and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the 
    given width and height.

/*
    MINIMUM
    Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

/* 
    RECURSION
    We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd 
    by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a 
    positive whole number is even or odd:

    Zero is even.

    One is odd.

    For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

    Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. 
    The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

    Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?
